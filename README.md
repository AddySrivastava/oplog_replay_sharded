## Features

- Replay collected oplogs onto a sharded cluster.
- Streamlined process for managing sharded MongoDB environments.

- Access to your sharded MongoDB cluster.
- MongoDB client tools installed on the machine running this script.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AddySrivastava/oplog_replay_sharded.git
   cd oplog_replay_sharded
